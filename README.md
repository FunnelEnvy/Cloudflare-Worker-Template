# FunnelEnvy: Cloudflare Workers for Website Experiments
This repo demonstrates several use cases for using a Cloudflare Worker to deliver website changes for experimentation. Using Cloudflare for this purpose has several benefits, including improved performance, reduced screen flicker, and direct control over the request/response cycle. 

Examples in this repo:
- [Direct DOM Manipulation](dom-manipulation/README.md)
- [Script Injection](script-injection/README.md)
- [Traffic Split](traffic-split/README.md)
