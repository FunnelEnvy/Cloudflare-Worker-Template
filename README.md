# FunnelEnvy: Cloudflare Workers for Website Experiments
This repo demonstrates several use cases for using multiple Cloudflare Workers to deliver website changes for experimentation. Using Cloudflare for this purpose has several benefits, including improved performance, reduced screen flicker, and direct control over the request/response cycle. 

Examples in this repo:
- [Direct DOM Manipulation](workers/dom-manipulation/README.md)
- [Script Injection](workers/script-injection/README.md)
- [Traffic Split](workers/traffic-split/README.md)
